<figure markdown>
  ![configured properties on settings page](../assets/settings.png){ loading=lazy }
  <figcaption>Basic settings example.</figcaption>
</figure>

!!! Note

    These are stored locally on each client (browser cache), so need to be configured on each of them. But therefore also allows different settings on each device.

!!! Info

    This part of the docs is still WIP.
