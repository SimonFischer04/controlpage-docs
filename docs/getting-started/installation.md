# Installation

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (including docker-compose)

## Setting up the project

To get a basic setup up and running use the sample docker-compose file here: [docker-compose.yml](https://gitlab.fischerserver.eu/controlpage/controlpage-releases/-/blob/main/docker-compose.yml)

!!! Info

    Basic samples for deploying it on kubernetes can also be found in the [releases repo](https://gitlab.fischerserver.eu/controlpage/controlpage-releases/-/tree/main/k8s), although this way of deploying is (currently) not updated.

## Advanced Setup (not required!)

For a more advanced setup you could for example set up a [reverse proxy](/advanced/reverse-proxy).
